# PowerBI Report PwC Simulation - Call Center and Customer Data Analysis
### Dashboard Overview

The Call Center Dashboard, developed using Power BI, as a part of PwC Simulation program, provides a comprehensive overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics related to call center operations. It offers insights into call volume, agent performance, customer satisfaction, and overall operational efficiency.

### Key KPIs and Metrics

- Overall Customer Satisfaction: Tracks the percentage of satisfied customers based on surveys or feedback mechanisms.
- Overall Calls Answered and Abandoned: Monitors the ratio of calls answered to calls abandoned, indicating service levels.
- Calls by Time: Analyzes call volume trends across different time periods (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) to identify peak times.
- Average Speed of Answer: Measures the average time it takes for a call to be answered by an agent.
- Agent's Performance Quadrant: Evaluates agent performance based on average handle time (talk duration) and calls answered.

### Customer Demographics and Risk Analysis Report

Based on the requirements and to address the retention manager's concerns in simulation, the dashboard incorporates additional metrics and visualizations focused on customer retention:

- Customer Churn Rate: Tracks the percentage of customers who have terminated their contracts.
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV): Calculates the estimated total revenue generated by a customer over their lifetime.
- Customer Segmentation: Groups customers based on demographics, usage patterns, and other relevant factors to identify at-risk segments.
- Customer Behavior Analysis: Monitors changes in customer behavior, such as reduced usage or increased complaints, to identify potential churn indicators.

### Key Findings and Recommendations

- Identifying At-Risk Customers: By analyzing customer segmentation data and behavior patterns, the dashboard can proactively identify customers who are likely to churn.
- Tailored Retention Strategies: Based on the identified at-risk segments, the retention team can implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized offers or proactive outreach.
- Improving Call Center Efficiency: The dashboard provides insights into call center operations, enabling the team to optimize staffing levels, improve agent training, and reduce call handling times.
- Data-Driven Decision Making: The dashboard empowers the retention manager to make data-driven decisions and allocate resources effectively.

And, the Dashboards provide valuable insights into call center performance and customer behavior. The KPIs we identified during the analysis indicate the necessity to,

- Increase tech support capacity for Fiber Optic customers and lower tech tickets per customer to 0.5.
- Increase sale of 1 and 2 year contracts by 5% each. 
- Yearly increase of automatic payments by 5%. 

By leveraging these insights, our telecom company can improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn, and enhance overall operational efficiency.
